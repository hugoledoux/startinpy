All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.0] - 2024-10-28
### Changed
- interpolation with NNI can now use the "precompute" of Voronoi vertices (speed up in many cases) 
- bindings now compiled for Python 3.12 with github actions and for linux
- many changes the docs
- upgrade to latest startin (which fixed a few bugs)
### Added
- comparison of DT speed with alternatives added
- folder `./paper/` contains the JOSS paper that was submitted and reviewed and accepted

## [0.11.0] - 2024-07-17
### Changed
- breaking change: all functions taking one location as argument (in 2D or 3D), now take an array `[x, y, z]` instead of the separate coordinates as different arguments. This harmonise all functions, and is better when dealing with NumPy. Functions affected: `insert_one_pt()`, `closest_point()`, `locate()`, and `is_inside_convex_hull()`.
- improve the pydocs + added a section about the extra attributes
- many bugs were fixed, eg PLY output is now valid, the CityJSON output now correctly omits the infinity vertex
- the `dt.jump_and_walk` is now exposed and can be used (if your dataset has little spatial coherence it could be useful)
- the latest version of maturin (to build the Python bindings from Rust) is now used
### Added
- vertices can now have extra attributes stored, eg to keep the LAS attributes (intensity, number_of_returns, etc.), a page in the docs was added with explanation and examples
- xy-duplicates are now handled and the behaviour can be configured. In previous versions, it was first-come-first-served, but now these 4 options are possible: First/Last/Highest/Lowest (First==default). This means that if a new vertex is an xy-duplicate (based on `dt.snap_tolerance`), the z value kept is depending on the configuration (the same is done if extra attributes are stored for the vertex).
- a full unit test suite (pytest) has been added, testing all functions
- there is now a `./demo` folder with several examples
### Removed
- the function `read_las()` is removed, using "laspy" is simpler/better/flexible so this this the favoured option. Demos and examples are added.


## [0.10.2] - 2023-12-14
### Changed
- fix a bug where function `adjacent_triangles_to_triangle()` returned only the finite triangles, while all (incl. infinite) should be returned


## [0.10.1] - 2023-11-21
### Changed
- improve the docs to explain how startinpy works
- added Python v3.12 support


## [0.10.0] - 2023-08-16
### Changed
- uses the new uses startin v0.7:
  - new interpolation mechanism
  - fix bugs
- outputs to GeoJSON and CityJSON was added
- has a new doc, better info and admittedly looks nicer


## [0.9.2] - 2022-11-14
### Changed
- bindings are built for the new python 3.11 as well now, from 3.7+


## [0.9.1] - 2022-09-28
### Changed
- uses startin = v0.6.1
- the much improved docs in `docs/` is now automatically built put at https://startinpy.rtfd.io/
### Added
- 2 functions related to garbage collection


## [0.9.0] - 2022-09-22
### Changed
- uses startin >= v0.6
- functions returns Exceptions if outside convexhull or wrong IDs
- general bug fixes
- PLY output so that QGIS can read directly with MDAL mesh
- new functions: `get_bbox()`, `__str()__`
### Added
- the much improved docs in `docs/` is now automatically built and put at https://hugoledoux.github.io/startinpy/


## [0.8.0] - 2021-12-22
### Changed
- the API is now using numpy for the arrays, you can use numpy arrays and the function that were returning lists are not returning numpy arrays
### Added
- a proper docs in `/docs`


## [0.7.0] - 2021-04-16
### Added
- startin v0.5 new features: 
  - interplation with natural neighbour (nni, or Sibson's method) is added. 
  - saving of the triangulation to GeoJSON is added
### Changed
- new name "startinpy" to avoid clashes with the rust lib "startin" on which this project is based on. Since I use a Rust builder (maturin), there were clashes and probably a better idea to call it "startinpy" anyway.
